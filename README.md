# AI-art-classifier

A residual CNN model that is able to classify art paintings' into 5 categories: Impressionism, Symbolism, Cubism, Romanticism, and Expressionism.

The Cubism and Romanticism were best classified by the model and Expressionism was the worst performing (in terms of True Positives/total paintings). 
The model was tested against a RESNet model that contains millions of nodes in its model and was not far off in terms of accuracy (+/-10%).

Included is the final presentation and the final report regarding our progress and our challenges.
